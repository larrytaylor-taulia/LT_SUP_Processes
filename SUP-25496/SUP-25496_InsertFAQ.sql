<h1><strong>Interest Charges</strong></h1>

<p>Q. How is the margin charged to suppliers under the Early Payment Program calculated?</p>

<ul>
	<li>The charge for early payment consists of two factors:

		<li>The appropriate reference rate*, e.g. LIBOR, CDOR, EURIBOR, etc.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Through the program, you are only charged for the number of days financed.</p>

<p>* Certain interest rate benchmarks are, or may in the future become, subject to ongoing international, national and other regulatory guidance, reform and proposals or reform. For more information, please consult:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jpmorgan.com/global/disclosures/interbank_offered_rates" target="_blank"><em>https://www.jpmorgan.com/global/disclosures/interbank_offered_rates</em></a></p>

<p>Q. Are there any additional charges applied other than the margin cost explained above?</p>

<ul>
	<li>There are no additional fees charged other than the above cost of receiving payment earlier, which will be deducted at the time of making the earlier payment. Use of the Platform is free and suppliers can choose to leave the Platform or Early Payment Program without any costs.</li>
