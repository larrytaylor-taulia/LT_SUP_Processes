<h1><strong>Using Taulia Q&amp;A</strong></h1>

<p><strong>Q. What is Taulia?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Taulia, a subsidiary of SAP, provides working capital solutions and a platform that allows Hapag-Lloyd suppliers to view the status of their invoices, receive remittance details, and request early payment for approved invoices. Taulia was acquired by SAP, March 10th, 2022, and is an official part of SAP&rsquo;s solution portfolio. All accounts payable processes will continue to be owned by Hapag-Lloyd.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Q. Who should I invite to my portal account?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Please add others to your company who will need access to the portal including for checking invoices, payments, etc.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Ftauliaknowledge.force.com%2Ftauliasupport%2Farticles%2Fen_US%2FAgent_Knowledge_Base%2FQ-How-do-I-add-or-deactivate-users%2F%3Fq%3Dadd%2Busers%26l%3Den_US%26fs%3DSearch%26pn%3D1&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFrqEzclL-DLOFd1WbNjyZZ2V6Xb3TQzvw" target=""_blank">Click here</a>&nbsp;to learn how to add users to your account.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please be informed that the maintenance of your Taulia account is fully under&nbsp;<strong>your responsibility</strong>.</p>

<p>Make sure that in the event of any change (users leaving your company, access removal, new admins, split/merge of companies, etc) your designated Taulia&nbsp;<strong>account administrator</strong>&nbsp;manages the complete access in the User Manager, by activating or deactivating users&nbsp;appropriately.</p>

<p>If you have only one admin user on the account, please be sure to add a new admin user before you leave the company. This will ensure that your company does not lose access to your Taulia portal.</p>

<h1><strong>Early Payment &amp; Discounting Q&amp;A</strong></h1>

<p><strong>Use the Taulia platform to accelerate the payment of your invoices through the early payment options.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Q. I have questions regarding the early payment rates for invoices. Who should I contact?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Please contact&nbsp;<a href="https://support.taulia.com/pkb_contact?exp=tau80v1" target=""_blank">Taulia Support</a>&nbsp;for any early payment related questions.</li>

<ul>
	<li>Early payment on your invoices is available from the point of approval, up until 9 days before your contractual payment date.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Q. Why do some approved invoices do not have an early payment offer?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>It is within Hapag-Lloyd discretion to offer early payment on any approved invoice. Please contact Hapag-Lloyd if you have question.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Q. </strong><strong>My invoice is approved but I can&#39;t request/accept early payment. Why?</strong></p>
